            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>As for the antiquity of naturall Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick in the practiſe, it is generally conceived co-Aged with the World, or the infancie thereof, a thing which little Children doe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally covet to learn, as they doe diſcourſe, a property annext unto every rationall Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; the firſt practitioners of this Art are

The ſecond Table I alſo here begin with a Unite, before which towards the left hand 1 place 2, and then in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond degree it makes twenty, ſo both the figures 21, and 2 in that place 10 times its own number: then put 3 before them, and it will be the hundreth place; and the character being 3, denotes three hundred; the three figures making in all 321 three hundred twenty and one: the fourth degree obtains the thouſand place, being tenne times greater than the third degree; and having the firſt figure before it 4, the value of the four figures will be 4321, that is, four thouſand three hundred twenty and one: the next degree is tenne thouſand, and the character being 5, it muſt be fifty thouſand, and the whole value of thoſe five figures 54321, and ſo all others proceeding in order by tennes.</p>
                           <p>Yet the better for to effect the computation of great numbers, when their degrees cannot eaſily be contain'd in memory; then it is neceſſary for to put periods unto every centurie, or three figures, and ſo numbring them in <hi>unites, tennes, hundreds;</hi> and then in expreſſing of their values, obſerve their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:116035:18"/> and the quantity of each figure as it is ſimply of it ſelf, and note that after the firſt period, their places are Thouſands, and after the ſecond period Millions; and after the next period Millions of mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions: and ſo proceeding with reiteration of unites, tennes, and hundreds, untill their periods are put unto them; by this means avoiding errours, ariſing in numbring of great quantities, and miſtaking their degrees, as in this example ſhall be illuſtrated, and ſuppoſe this number given, whoſe quantity is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, <hi>viz:</hi> 1, 234, 567, 890 which having poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, read thus: one Million of millions two hundred thirty four millions, five hundred ſixty ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, eight hundred and ninety.

                        <p>When any ſubtraction is to be made, the leſſer muſt be deducted from the greater, or equall things from other quantities that are equall, but a greater from a leſſe cannot be deducted in the whole, yet in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars they may, when the praecedent numbers towards the left hand ſhall be greater, from whence the ſubtraction is to be made, as ſhall be illuſtrated by examples, and firſt obſerve to write in figures the greater number, and under that the leſſer, and in ſuch order as was preſcrib'd in Addition, according to their ranks and places, whether they be <hi>Cyphers</hi> or ſignificant figures as unites under unites, tennes
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:116035:24"/> under tennes, &amp;c. Yet notwithſtanding when the leſſer number is under the greater according to their places, a ſignificant figure may be under a cypher, or a greater under the leſſe; in ſuch caſes, take an unite from the place before it, towards the left hand, it will be 10 in that ranke, which adde to it, and then ſubtract the former number, and keep the unite which was borrow'd, in your minde, and adde that to the lower number in the next place; for the upper number was to have been an unite leſſe, therefore if the lower precedent number be made a unite greater it is all one: as if 9 were to be ſubtracted from 10; and plac'd according to my direction, it cannot be taken from a cypher alone, but as a decimall it may, and 1 will remaine. Againe, admit 19 to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from 21, 9 cannot be taken from 1, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuppoſe an unite borrow'd of 2 &amp; then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer 1 will be made 11, from whence take 9, and there will remaine 2, now 'tis all one whether I make 2 in the 21 but 1, or the Decimall 1 I bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd be added to 1 in the 19, and ſo make that 2, which is the beſt way, and then take 2 from 2 and nothing remaines but 2, the firſt ſubtraction; for the difference betwixt 21 and 19. If ſeverall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers were to be ſubtracted, from divers other ſums, collect them all into one by Addition, and likewiſe thoſe which are to be ſubtracted, and then finde the difference between them; for this rule or <hi>Species</hi> admits but of two ſummes; theſe principles obſerv'd, the reſt will be clear'd by examples following.</p>

                           <p>Or a triall whether you have done right or no, there be divers rules, but the beſt and generall way, is to make one of theſe <hi>Species</hi> prove the other; as when divers numbers are added together, from the ſumme ſubtract the parts, and you will produce the former numbers; and where a ſubtraction is made, to try that; adde the difference or remainder, to the numbers ſubtracted which is leaſt, and the ſumme will give the greater number; or from any number ſubtracted, take the difference from the greater gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven number, and the remainder will be the leſſer number that was ſubtracted: for alwayes, where there are 2 numbers ſubtracted, as the remainder is the difference betwixt thoſe numbers given, ſo the leſſer given number is the difference between the remainder, and the greater given number; for every
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:116035:28"/> remainder muſt be leſſe then the greater number, by the quantity of the leſſer, therefore 'tis the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them; yet though tis evident I will illuſtrate it with examples in both <hi>Species,</hi> how they mutually do try one another.</p>
                           <p>In the firſt example of Addition, if from the ſum of 792 you take C, 231, the remainder will be 561, the ſumme of A and B, from whence ſubtract either of their parts, and the other will remaine, as take away A 320, and there will remaine 241 for B, or if 241 had been ſubtracted from 561, there had remained 320 for A, and thus you may proceed in any other, either of one denomination or of many.</p>
                           <p>To try whether Subtraction made, be true, take the laſt example of mixt numbers, and ſay 18 and 30 is 48, that is 8 Pole and 1 intiger in the next co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumne, ſo proceed, 1 and 3 makes 4 and 1 will be 5, that is 1 Roode and goe 11 Acres; then 1 and 9 is 10 and 2 will be 12 that is 2 and goe 1 decimall, which with 9 and 2 will be 11, ſubſcribe 1 and goe 1, which added to 9 makes 10, a cypher and goe 1, laſtly 1 and 8 makes 9, ſo the ſumme is 9012 A, 1 R, 8 P, as before: or to try this by ſubtraction, take the remainder from the greater number, their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence will be the leſſer number which was ſubtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if it were rightly perform'd, as take 18 from 48 and there will remaine 30 P, take 4 Roode out of 5 and there will remaine 1 R, take 10 Acres out of 12 and there will remaine 2, take 10 out of 11 and there will remaine 1, then take 1 out of 10 and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder will be 9, laſtly 1 and 8 is 9, take 9 from 9, and nothing remaines, and the other figures ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:116035:29"/> will make 912 A. 1 R. 30 P. the leſſer given number: and thus by finding either of them by the remainder, it proves the worke undoubtedly true.</p>

                        <p>The <hi>Multiplier</hi> is uſually the leaſt, and alwayes the lower number: it is to encreaſe the <hi>Multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cand</hi> as many times as there be unites contained in the <hi>Multiplier;</hi> as if 6 were to be multiplied by 4, they would produce 24, and ſo would 6 times 4; that is 4 added 6 times together, for the number of unites contained in the <hi>Multiplier.</hi>

                           <p>This Table conſiſts of the mutuall multiplication of all the nine ſignificant figures, proceeding from an unite to 9 either way; that is, from A to B, and from A to D, according to the orderly ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of theſe numerall characters, every one having their ſeverall Products, or number of unites con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in their multiplications, which ought for to be learned without book, and imprinted in your memory; yet to facilitate the labour of young be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners, I have here ſubſcribed this Table, eaſie to be underſtood, and a readily to be remembred, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into 91 little ſquares; every one containing the Product, made by the ſimple figure in the head of the Table over it, and that in the ſide right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

                           <p>And farther you may here obſerve how every ſimple figure multiplied in its ſelfe, is terminated, untill it returns to its own character again; as for example, 1 multiplies nothing, but ſtill remains an unite, being no number of it ſelfe; 2 multiplied by 2 ends in 4, 8, 6, and fourthly is terminated in 2 its root; 3 by 3 ends in 9, 7, 1, and fourthly in 3 a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; 4 by 4 ends in 6, and ſecondly in 4, next 5 &amp; 6 multiplied in themſelves, are terminated in their own figures, and from thence are called Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular numbers; 7 multiplied by 7 ends in 9, 3, 1, and fourthly, in its ſelf; 8 by 8 ends in 4, 2, 6, and fourthly, in its ſelfe again; 9 multiplied by 9 will end in 1, and in every ſecond multiplication is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated in 9, its own root, or number again pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:116035:66"/> as for example to ſubtract ⅔ parts from ¾ of a ſhilling take ⅔ from the Integer, and there will remain ⅓, as by the 17 <hi>Parad: Sect:</hi> 2. <hi>Parag:</hi> 1. then multiply ⅓ by ¾ the product will be 3/12 or ¼ s. which is thus proved; ¾ s. or 9 d. is the fraction propounded, and 'tis required to take ⅔ parts of the ſame fraction from it, which ⅔ parts is 6 d. ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted out of 9 d. the difference is 3 d. or ¼ s. as before.

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:116035:120"/> the leſſer of the two extremes given muſt be Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, and if the fourth number ought to be leſſe than the ſecond terme, then the greater of the two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes is Diviſor.</p>

                              <p>This is alſo the <hi>Golden Rule,</hi> and differs nothing from the former in the operation, but in making the third number Diviſor, and the fourth propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall ſought to proceed from the firſt; as if 3 Men in 18 Dayes did reap a certaine number of Acres of Wheat, and it is required to know in how many Dayes would 12 Men have reaped the corn in the ſame field; it is evident that if 3 men could effect this worke in 18 Dayes, a greater number of equall workmen muſt performe it in fewer dayes; then it is the <hi>Rule Three</hi> reverſt, and by the laſt <hi>Canon,</hi> the greater extreme of the three numbers given muſt be the Diviſor, which here is 12; then 18 multiplied by 3 produceth 54, which divided by 12, the Quotient is 4 ½ Day: ſo 12 Men may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the ſame work in 4 Aequinoxiall dayes and 6 Houres, as the 3 Men did in 18 Dayes; for as 12 containes 3 juſt 4 times, ſo does 18 containe 4½, and the 4 proportionall numbers will ſtand in the Rule thus:</p>

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:116035:134"/> another, and couple them together with an arch of a circle; the price ſet muſt be alwaies leſſer than the greateſt price, and greater than the leaſt of the particulars, as here 8 is leſſer than 10, and greater than 3: this done the difference between the price ſet, and each particular muſt be found, and counter-changed with the number, to which it is coupled, as in the firſt Table, the difference betwixt 8 &amp; 10 is 2, which is placed againſt 3. the difference between 8 &amp; 3 is 5, which ſtands againſt 10. the ſumme of the differences is 7, which according to the Rule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and the Table, at B, ſtands in the firſt place: 112 pound, the quantity to be mixt the ſecond number; and each particular correſpondent diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the third number: ſo it is now in the Rule of proportion, as 7 the totall difference, to 112 pound the totall quantity; ſo will 5 (the particular reſpective difference for the beſt price) be to 80 pound, the quantity to be taken of that ſort.

In this Example there are two Tables, the firſt is in one degree of heat, whoſe <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex</hi> is 6. yet by the commixture of another Simple is to be encreaſed unto the third degree of heat. Take any Simple or Compoſition, which is either equall in the temperature, or greater, in this I take one in the fourth degree of heat, whoſe <hi>Index</hi> is 9: place this under the <hi>Index,</hi> whoſe temperature is known, <hi>viz:</hi> 6. the difference of theſe two, and 8 propounded is counterchanged 1 &amp; 2, then ſay, as the difference of that known, and that given, or the difference of the <hi>Index</hi> 1 propounded to the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the Confection made 6 <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>; ſo ſhall the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of 2 (the <hi>Index</hi>) be in proportion unto the quantity of the Simple that is to be mixt: ſo it is, as 1 unto 2, ſo 6 <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> to 12 <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>; or as 1 to 6 <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>, ſo 2 unto 12 <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>. And ſo much of that which is hot in 4 degrees, commixt with another hot in the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, the temperature will be in three degrees of heat, as will appear in the Table of their qualities. And ſo likewiſe in the ſecond Table of this Example, the Confection which was moyſt in the firſt degree is to be made temperate: D 4 is the <hi>Index</hi> unto the quality given, which muſt be annihilated, like the common people of theſe times, as neither hot nor cold. Take the <hi>Index</hi> of ſome required Simple, whoſe degree is either equall, or greater: as here
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:116035:146"/> admit one, in the ſecond degree of heat, whoſe <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex</hi> is 7 G. the difference of each <hi>Index</hi> tranſcribed according to the laſt, or firſt <hi>Queſtion</hi> of this <hi>Parag:</hi> the difference D 2. &amp; G 1. now the proportion will be, as 2 to 1 ſo 6 <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> unto 3 <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>, or 2 unto 6 <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>: ſo 1 to 3 <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>. and 3 Drams of a Simple, hot in the ſecond degree, added to a Confection of 6 Drams, moyſt in the firſt degree, in reſpect of moyſture it would have been in that quality, neither hot nor cold, nor yet drie or moyſt, if their qualities correſpond.</p>
                        <p>In the firſt of theſe Examples, the Compoſition 6 <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>, hot in the firſt degree, being mixt with 12 <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> hot in the fourth degree, the whole Confection was made hot in the third degree, but yet is held moyſt in the firſt degree, as it was before: although ſome affirm, not onely heat does abate cold, drought &amp; moyſture, but alſo moyſture and drought leſſens cold; two of theſe qualities being but by accident. So to return, if the laſt Compoſition which was made hot in the third degree, and moyſt in the firſt, the whole Confection of 18 <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>, may be encreaſed, or diminiſhed in the degree of moyſture by one of the laſt Examples, to which I referre you, repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being unneceſſary: if the quantities of any Simple, or Compoſition to be made, ſhould happen in a fraction, or in ſeverall denominations, <hi>viz:</hi>
